    As a Computer Science major, I have developed a strong foundation in coding with proficiency in C++ and Python, and have applied these skills in real-world projects. I successfully built a bank application, implementing both front-end and back-end functionality, and a mobile flashcard application using Kotlin, which enhanced my expertise in Android development. My experience spans across full-stack development, where I contributed to both front-end user interfaces and back-end systems, demonstrating my ability to work across the development lifecycle. I am eager to leverage my technical skills and problem-solving abilities to contribute to innovative projects.
